# AMP Sequence Generation with RankGAN

This repository contains the implementation of RankGAN for the generation of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) sequences. The project aims to utilize generative adversarial networks to create novel AMP sequences.

## Prerequisites

It's recommended to set up a virtual environment for this project to avoid conflicts with other packages or Python versions.

Ensure you have Python 3.6 installed on your virtual environment. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/).

```bash
# Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
