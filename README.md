# AMP Sequence Generation with RankGAN

This repository contains the implementation of RankGAN for the generation of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) sequences. The project aims to utilize generative adversarial networks to create novel AMP sequences with potential therapeutic applications.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6 installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/).

## Creating a Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment and activate it, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shant-kolekar/rankGAN.git
cd rankGAN
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
